#2020 House Election Estimation Project(R): 

Use 2018 Population Estimates Program (PEP) data to estimate the number of House of Representative members for each state expected from the results of the upcoming 2020 census.


 I used R programming to estimate the House seats distribution in the United States in 2020 to predict the upcoming House of Representative Election. I built a model that applies the Equal proportions algorithm to generate the number of house seats of each state using 2018 population data from American FactFinder, a website maintained by the Census Bureau. I compared my estimation results with the current House Distribution which is based on 2010 census data and used ggplot2 visualized the results in a U.S. map with each color representing the numbers of seats change.
